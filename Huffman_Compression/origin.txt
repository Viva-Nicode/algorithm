Can you hear the crystal melody
With a small hint of misery?
Life sometimes promises warmth tomorrow
Just like a dusky sunset in splendor
I remember the humming sound is passing by
The tears we have held back
All the dreams that I have lost
In the precious days
Just keep on dreaming and dreaming
Alone in the faded paradise
Your heart that is lighting up the world
Takes me to the beautiful dawn
Can you see the place I used to stay
Waiting for you to call me?
Life sometimes becomes a shining starlight
Gazing at you make my heart more flutter
Just keep on dreaming and dreaming
Don't you fold your wings in doubt
Each piece of precious memory
They will make you fly away
I will be there in your memory
Sweet, sweet, dreams my dear
