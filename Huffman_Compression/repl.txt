Can you hear the crystal melodyWith a small hint of misery?Life sometimes promises warmth tomorrowJust like a dusky sunset in splendorI remember the humming sound is passing byThe tears we have held backAll the dreams that I have lostIn the precious daysJust keep on dreaming and dreamingAlone in the faded paradiseYour heart that is lighting up the worldTakes me to the beautiful dawnCan you see the place I used to stayWaiting for you to call me?Life sometimes becomes a shining starlightGazing at you make my heart more flutterJust keep on dreaming and dreamingDon't you fold your wings in doubtEach piece of precious memoryThey will make you fly awayI will be there in your memorySweet, sweet, dreams my deai  e
